# Serverless Web Application on AWS
# Description
In this project, you will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete [CRUD] items from a DynamoDB table.
# Project Architecture
# Steps to build the project:
* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items.
* Build the Lmbda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files.
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.
# Outcome
Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS, with hands on experience using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront.
