# Terraform
Terraform is an [IaC] Infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative configuration file.

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

**1. Terraform**

**2. AWS CLI Credentials**
# Terraform commands and its usage
1. Edit your Terraform configuration files **(.tf)** to define your infrastructure resources, providers, and variables.

2. Run **terraform validate** to catch any syntax errors or configuration issues

3. Run **terraform plan** to see a preview of the changes that Terraform will make.

4. If the plan looks correct, run **terraform apply** to apply the changes to your infrastructure.

5. To destroy the resources when they are no longer needed, run **terraform destroy**.
